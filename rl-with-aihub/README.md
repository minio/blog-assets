# Deepseek-style Reinforcement Learning Against Object Store

Set the following environment variables to point to AIHub:
```
export HF_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint
export HF_TOKEN=your_token
```

If these variables are not set, the script will default to using public HuggingFace Hub.

Run the script with:
```
uv run main.py
```
